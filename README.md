# Clipboard
This uses jQuery to copy text to the clipboard. You can use it for free in your projects, but please give me some credit if you use it.\
The examples are at https://dacuteraccoon.github.io/clipboard/src/v2/index.html and https://dacuteraccoon.github.io/clipboard/src/v1/index.html. To use this, edit the files to your liking and use in your website. The differences between v1 and v2 are v1 uses a ```window.alert()``` and v2 uses a popup message that says it has been copied. 
# Usage
For example, if you want to embed it into your website, use this code:
```html
<iframe src="https://dacuteraccoon.github.io/clipboard/src/v2/index.html" title="Copy to clipboard">
</iframe>
```
But what you should do is edit it to your preferences, save it as a ```.html``` file, upload it into your website, and use it. But make sure to add some type of credit. Any type is fine. You could even just say 
```html
